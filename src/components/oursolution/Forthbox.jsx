              equitable compensation, and with fewer guests carrying cash these
              days, there's been a noticeable decline in tip earnings. By
              offering guests an option for cashless gratuities, staff are
              further encouraged to deliver outstanding service, recognizing the
              potential rewards for their efforts.

              Guests often skip tipping service industry staff not due to
              unsatisfactory service, but because they lack cash. Our digital
              tipping platform provides guests the opportunity to express their
              gratitude to service staff using diverse digital payment methods,
              such as ApplePay and Google Pay.

              For service industry merchants, depending on how your payroll is
              structured, you might choose to transfer tips straight into
              employees' bank accounts or merge them with their usual salaries
              via your payroll mechanism. Whichever approach you take, the
              digital tipping system streamlines the disbursement procedure and
              allows you to keep track of your staff tips earnings.
